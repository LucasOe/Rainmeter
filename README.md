**Notes:**
* Wallpaper for Wallpaper Engine can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1427158512).
* The [Clock](https://www.deviantart.com/twistlemon/art/Elegant-Clock-215023089) isn't part of the suite.
* Rightclick on the very left Icon in the dock shows / hides the taskbar. To support this use [Tranclucent Taskbar](https://gist.github.com/arkenthera/7a807e04ee8f1d95425f710944667508).
* Righclicking on the folders in the launcher opens them in the Windows Explorer.
* Clicking on the "Desktop" Label in the launcher brings you back to the Desktop.
